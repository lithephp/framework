## [1.3.2] - 2024-11-14

### Fixed
- **Corrected router instance check in the `any` function**:
    - Updated the `any` function to properly verify if `$router` is an instance of `Router`.
    - Adjusted the condition to throw an exception only when `$router` is not a valid `Router` instance.
    - Improved error handling when the router instance is missing, increasing function reliability.

### Refactored
- **Enhanced route registration and creation with Orbis in the `Lithe\App` class**:
    - Replaced `Orbis::instance` with `Orbis::unregister` when registering routes, ensuring the instance is discarded after use.
    - Improved the `createRouterFromFile` method in the `Lithe\App` class to verify that the object returned from Orbis is an instance of `Router`.
    - Added extra validations and error messages for missing or invalid router configuration files.
    - Enhanced error handling and logging for cases where route registration fails.

## [1.3.1] - 2024-11-09

### Fixed
- **Adjusted mapping for 'index.php' files in subdirectories**:
    - Updated the logic to map 'index.php' in the root of the application to `/`:
        - 'index.php' at the root is now mapped to `/`.
        - 'subdir/index.php' is now mapped to `/subdir/index`, maintaining the subdirectory structure.

## [1.3.0] - 2024-11-08

### Modified
- **Add support for defining route directories using the set method**:
    - Implemented the `set` method to dynamically configure route directories, providing more flexibility in defining the base directory for routes.
    - Refactored route loading logic to support configurable directories, simplifying customization of route sources.
    - Improved route file inclusion to avoid redundancy, ensuring cleaner and more efficient route handling.
    
## [1.2.3] - 2024-11-07

### Modified
- **Adds template validation for make: migration, model, and seeders commands**: If the template configured in the environment variable does not exist, a default template is created automatically.

- **Refactor of param and extractCookies methods**:
    - **param**: Updated to handle URL-decoded values directly.
    - **extractCookies**: Replaced the anonymous object with a class featuring dynamic properties, allowing direct access to cookie values through `__get`, `__set`, and an `exists` method for existence checks.
    These improvements enhance the handling of parameters and cookies in the system.
    
## [1.2.2] - 2024-11-03

### Modified
- **Refactor query parameter handling**: Changed to a direct property access method using `__get` to simplify access to query parameters.

## [1.2.1] - 2024-10-31

### Modified
- **make:seeder command update**: Modified the `make:seeder` command to default to the environment connection method (`DB_CONNECTION_METHOD`) when no template option is specified.
- **Template validation enhancement**: Improved validation to ensure that the specified template is valid before proceeding with file creation, providing a clearer error message if invalid.
- **Enhanced feedback messages**: Updated the feedback messages for better user experience, confirming success or reporting errors when creating seeder files.

## [1.2.0] - 2024-10-28

### Added
- **Create .env file for test configuration**: Added a `.env` file to facilitate test configuration.
- **Add support for Seeder commands**: Implemented the structure to support seeder commands.
- **Add make:seeder and db:seed commands**: New commands introduced for creating and executing seeders.

### Modified
- **Remove .env from .gitignore**: The `.env` file was removed from `.gitignore`, allowing its inclusion in the repository.
- **Update Model generation templates**: Updates to model generation templates for better compatibility and organization.
- **Refactor middleware template to use class-based definition**: Refactored middleware templates to utilize class-based definitions, improving code readability and structure.
